<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an entrepreneur driven by creativity, technology, and innovation. From starting as a video editor and working with both Indian and international clients to building my own online ventures like Creatizm and Techseker, my journey has been all about growth. Now, I am expanding my expertise in web development and graphic design, aiming to create impactful digital solutions that stand out in the industry.</p>

<p>Managing my time effectively is a priority for me, especially with my packed college schedule from 9 AM to 7 PM. Alongside academics, I am constantly learningâ€”whether it's web development, graphic design, or business strategies. I believe in continuous improvement, which is why I also focus on reading books and networking on LinkedIn to connect with potential freelance clients. My ultimate goal is to become financially independent by March 31, 2025, and I am working hard to achieve that.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I am also working on refining my communication and language abilities. I actively seek corrections in my sentence framing and grammar to improve clarity and professionalism. For me, growth is not just about mastering skills but also about evolving as a person. With determination, discipline, and a clear vision, I am building a future where I can turn my passion into a successful and sustainable career.</p>
